This is a very basic outline of a reusable django project/application. It will read its url entries that are defined, and by requesting a specific URL string (http://www.site.com/main/service/model-name/show/23) you will be able to do show/add/edit/delete functions through a single view controller to avoid code repetition and customize your forms for non-admin users.<br />
